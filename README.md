Throughout this entire, I've learned how to add buttons, text input components, and label components to JPanel. Most importantly I learned why it is very very VERY important to organize code into two main different sections like a "front-end" and a "back-end" where the front end is the UI that the user perceives as a list and the back end where all the variables and calculations are being processed. In this case, the front end is the list where the user can interact with and the back end has a very stupidly designed storage system to store all the numbers inputted. But I, unfortunately, did not separate both front and back end and instead, I just smushed everything together which is somewhat confusing and makes it harder to add more components to JPanel.  


#Bugs
There are no bugs that I am aware of as of right now.

#Credit to
Well I guess the Java API tutorial website and some StackOverFlow threads to learn how to use JPanel.
